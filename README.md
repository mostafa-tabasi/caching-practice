# Caching Practice
This simple Android project shows the implementation of local caching using Paging library component, **PagingSource**, to handles paging from a layered data source, such as a network data source with a local database cache.

Features:
- **Clean Architecture** for separating concerns for better maintainability and testability.
- [**Jetpack Compose**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) for a declarative and efficient UI experience.
- [**Hilt**](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for dependency injection and simplified component management.
- [**Paging3**](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) for enabling smooth and efficient handling of large datasets for pagination.
- [**Retrofit**](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for efficient network communication and API interactions.
- [**Jetpack Room**](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for persistent data storage with a local database.


Updates:

**Mock API Calls:** Due to the original API no longer being functional, the project now utilizes mock data generation for demonstration purposes.
